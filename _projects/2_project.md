Over the last 100 years, the field of solar physics has seen an unprecedented amount of data being generated. Space  and ground based telescopes provide long-term, continuous coverage of the sun. Naturally, with such an explosion of information, our ability to extract meaningful science is also enhanced. In parallel, the field of machine learning has also burgeoned in the last few years, allowing a harmonic amalgamation of these two fields. 

The Kodaikanal Solar Observatory (KSO) has been taking daily images of the sun since 1904. Long term continuous coverage of the sun is essential in understanding the solar dynamo and studying the 22 year solar cycle. Studying this phenomenon is not only crucial in understanding solar dynamics, but also in understanding its effects on space weather and consequently, on Earth. 

The project aimed to generate high resolution magnetograms from Ca-II-K images from the Kodaikanal Dataset.
