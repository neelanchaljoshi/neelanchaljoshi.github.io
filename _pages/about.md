I am a PhD student at the MPI for Solar System Research in Goettingen. Before this, I did my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with a Masters in Physics from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India. Being an Army brat, I have never lived in a place for more than two years. Still, my current "home base" is Dehradun, a small city on the foothills of the Himalayas.

I am interested in studying the newly discovered inertial modes of oscillations in the sun. Inertial modes are low-frequency large scale oscillations that allow us to study properties deep in the solar interior. More specifically, I am using a method called Local Correlation Tracking to measure flows on the surface of the sun, and looking for signatures of these inertial modes in the flow data. Additionally I am also interested in machine learning and big data applications in astronomy. Astronomy has seen an unprecedented amount of data being generated in the last decade and this allows machine learning to solve some very challenging problems in the field.

When I am not busy scratching my head about science, you can find me playing some sport or the other, doing CrossFit, quizzing, or watching any movie/series I can get my hands on :)
